# ADPI frontend

This is a basic frontend Vue.js app I made as part of an assessment for ADPI.

It can make calls and present data either directly from tronalddump.io, or via the ADPI backend API that I made in Laravel 8, which you may feel free to clone from my repositories and set up in your environment.

By default this frontend is set up to communicate with the ADPI backend server, but this can easily be changed by setting the adpi data attribute in index.js to false. It will then communicate directly with tronalddump.io

The dependencies Vue.js and axios.js are loaded through CDN, so using the app is as simple as downloading the three index files and opening the index.html in your brower

Enjoy!
